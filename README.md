#-Digital-Wardrobe
The Digital Wardrobe is a Python-based graphical user interface that lets you mix and match different tops and bottoms from your wardrobe. The app allows users to navigate through images of tops and bottoms, generating a new outfit at the click of a button. It's a tool to visualize outfits without needing to pull everything out of your wardrobe
